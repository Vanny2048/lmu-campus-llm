        "title": "Not Just a Bible Study: A Warning for LMU Students",
        "content": "**Hey Lions,**\n\nThis is my third time sharing this with you all, and each time, it's been met with support, upvotes, and direct messages from students who’ve said it helped them feel informed and validated. I’ve carefully edited this post to follow this subreddit’s rules and to ensure it's respectful and constructive. I hope the mods will consider its purpose, which is to keep our campus community safe and aware, and allow it to stay up.\n\nLMU is a place that stands for critical thinking, truth, and respect for all people. But sometimes, unfortunately, that openness gets taken advantage of.\n\nRecently, students have been approached,  on campus and nearby spots like Westfield Culver City or Playa Vista, by people inviting them to “Bible studies” or asking if they've heard of “God the Mother” or a “hidden truth” in the Bible. These friendly invitations are coming from a group called the **World Mission Society Church of God (WMSCOG)**,  though you usually won’t hear that name until much later.\n\nHere’s what students across LA , from LMU to UCLA, USC, CSUN, and UC Irvine — have reported:\n\n* **They rarely identify who they are up front.** They’ll talk about faith or the Bible, but avoid saying they’re with WMSCOG until you’re already invested.\n* **They preach that God is a Korean woman, Zahng Gil-jah**, and that the end of the world is imminent,  but they wait to reveal this.\n* **Ex-members have described emotional pressure**, being asked to cut off family and friends, commit large amounts of time and money, and follow strict teachings based on fear.\n* **This is not just a local Bible group.** They are organized, well-trained, and intentionally targeting young adults, especially women, on campuses.\n\nThis isn’t just happening at LMU. Students across Southern California have spoken out, and some universities have begun hosting panels and forums to raise awareness about high-pressure or manipulative religious recruitment.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about attacking anyone’s faith. LMU values spiritual exploration and freedom of religion. But **faith must be chosen freely, not manipulated, not sold under pressure, and not masked by secrecy.**\n\nIf you’ve been approached, you are *not* alone. Trust your instincts. Ask questions. Do your research. The more informed our community is, the less space there is for deception.\n\n# To the mods, again, I’ve posted this three times now. Students are engaging with it because it’s something real that’s happening to them. I’ve edited this carefully to meet the rules, and I hope you'll consider its value. If it’s removed again, I can’t help but question whether you're unintentionally protecting an organization that is repeatedly accused of predatory behavior.\n\n**Let’s keep LMU a place where belief is genuine — not manipulated, not coerced.**\n\n**A Concerned Student Who Cares About Truth and Freedom of Thought**",

        "title": "What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate",
        "content": "This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.\n\n\n\n**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**\n\nThe vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on. Practice doesn't make perfect, *targeted* practice makes perfect.\n\n  \n**#2 - You need to interact with artists outside of LMU.**\n\nMost LMU animation students interact primarily with other LMU animation students. You need to be networking and befriending animation students at *other universities*. Go to the CalArts open show, the ArtCenter grad show, meet USC animation students and UCLA animation students. These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.\n\n  \n**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!\n\nUse social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.\n\n  \n**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**\n\nThis is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: \"I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV\". \"I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation\". \"I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games\". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your \"deal\" is.\n\n\n\n**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**\n\nYour portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.\n\nYour portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (\"I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!\") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.\n\n  \n**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**\n\nYour short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.\n\n  \n**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**\n\nThousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. \n\nFor art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.\n\n  \n**#8 - Be a critical person.**\n\nLMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just \"good enough\".\n\nEveryone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. \n\n  \n**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**\n\nYou're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.\n\nAny time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!\n\n  \n**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**\n\nEvery role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.\n\n  \nGood luck future animation grads!",

        "title": "For Parents, Family members, friends, &amp; Attendees: Recap of  2025 and Tips for Graduation (Commencement) Ceremony &amp; Events",
        "content": "I looked through Reddit and LMU's website to plan for my youngest graduation events, celebrations, and ceremony and couldn't find the answers. So from my personal experiences, I am sharing them.\n\n* Flights: Book your flights once you know the date of the graduation. LAX is the closest and you can take a Lyft or Uber to your accommodation. It sounds like a big deal, but it really isn't. There are shuttles to hotels and you can take the shuttle to the metro to catch one of the lines if your accommodation is near one of the metro stop. For the past 4 years, I never had any issues with LAX. I actually flying in and out, because it is easy.\n\nYou can also fly into Burbank or Long Beach, but it is a little farther. Flying out of LAX is a breeze as well.\n\n* Accommodations (Tips for Graduation, move-in &amp; move-out): Book your hotel accommodations once you know the date of the graduation. Most people like to stay at the Ritz or one of the hotels along Century Boulevard. However, **our choice for 4 years has been Residence Inn in El Segundo on El Segundo Blvd.** It has a kitchen, quiet, free breakfast, parking onsite without height restrictions ($15.00 per night). Everyone is super nice.\n   * We have stayed at the Residence Inn on Century Boulevard (for move-in), but the parking is challenging as we navigate stairs and incline with luggages.  Parking has a vehicle height minimum. Shuttle Available.\n   * Then, the following year, we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott on Century Boulevard. Great hotel, lots of outdoor parking so vehicle height doesn't matter. The lobby is great, but then, the walk to the hotel room seems far especially after being tired from move-in all day. Shuttle available.\n   * The other hotel we tried was Hyatt Place LAX. The parking lot has a vehicle height minimum and the incline again was funky and was hard to navigate with the move-out/move-in of luggage and items. Liked the rooms. 15 mins. walk from LAX\n   * Courtyard LAX Century Blvd. on Vicksburg. Parking is open and no vehicle height, but $50 per night last time I was there. Super close to the airport and can walk there in 10-15 mins from the luggage depending if it is busy with traffic. Rooms are spacious.\n* How many days before the graduation? It depends on your schedule and availability. I thought that driving into town Thursday night the day before the baccalaureate mass (Friday) was enough, but we were exhausted. Friday was a whirlwind because of all the errands that we had to run just to prepare for graduation:\n   1. Find a last minute dog-sitter, because our original dog sitter in Manhattan Beach flaked. Found a better one at the local dog park. Thanks to Josh!\n   2. Picked up two amazing graduations cakes at Ador in Redondo Beach. Big thanks to Kaity! We loved the diary-free cake and the creme brulee! What a hit!\n   3. Grab lunch\n   4. relax for 1 hour before leaving fo the mass.\n* Baccalaureate mass: Wear comfy clothing, check the weather, and bring a sweater just in case if it is below 70 degrees. It was windy and cold on May 16, 2025. Many people left  right after communion, because it was super windy and cold. Bathrooms at the bottom of the building next to the library if you do not want to use the port-a-potties. Parking is super easy. There is water available. Missalettes were handed out. Communion was super long. The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins. Gave her time to spend with friends. There are golf carts/ADA sign available if you have mobility challenges. ADA seating is in the back of the garden.\n* Security: Remember clear bags or small purses (refer to the bag policy).  *My significant other had to walk back to the car and place his bag back at the vehicle.* They will then scan your ticket. This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front. It's a 1st come-1st serve basis. So, arrive early if you want the center aisle. *I wish that I did that because the camera did not televise the aisle where my youngest walked. I saw 15 seconds of her.* Remind people not to stand in front so that you can take pics of your graduate. Later in the ceremony, it became chaotic with all the parents standing in front of other people. I had to remind a few people to grab a chair next to us. Then, they were happy. Be on alert for the your graduate's school and name. The announcer spoke fast as if they were at an auction. if your graduate is an honors student, move near the fron railing and take a pic when they are announced. None of the honors students were televised. This event ended around 1:50 p.m.\n* Meeting place: After the event, pick a meeting place. *We stayed where we sat and took great pics from there.*\n* After ceremony events: If your graduate is not too tired, go straight to the naming wall. *We forgot to go there and it was gone the next day.* Each school has a reception. *We just took pics.*\n* Exiting parking structures and lots: It will take about 30 mins to exit. Traffic control will direct you where to go.\n* After parties: our graduates and their friends &amp; families were super tired, but we booked a restaurant back in Feb to accommodate 12 people.\n* Tickets: your graduate should be sending them to you via email. There is a QR Code.\n* Food: Pack your graduate a sandwich or snacks. They will be hungry (hangry) by the time the ceremony is done.\n\nI hope this helps parents, families, friends, and attendees with future graduates.\n\nCongratulations to the LMU's class of 2025!",

These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.\n\n  \n**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!\n\nUse social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.\n\n  \n**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**\n\nThis is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: \"I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV\". \"I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation\". \"I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games\". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your \"deal\" is.\n\n\n\n**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**\n\nYour portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.\n\nYour portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (\"I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!\") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.\n\n  \n**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**\n\nYour short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.\n\n  \n**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**\n\nThousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. \n\nFor art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.\n\n  \n**#8 - Be a critical person.**\n\nLMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just \"good enough\".\n\nEveryone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. \n\n  \n**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**\n\nYou're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.\n\nAny time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!\n\n  \n**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**\n\nEvery role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.\n\n  \nGood luck future animation grads!",

        "content": "I looked through Reddit and LMU's website to plan for my youngest graduation events, celebrations, and ceremony and couldn't find the answers. So from my personal experiences, I am sharing them.\n\n* Flights: Book your flights once you know the date of the graduation. LAX is the closest and you can take a Lyft or Uber to your accommodation. It sounds like a big deal, but it really isn't. There are shuttles to hotels and you can take the shuttle to the metro to catch one of the lines if your accommodation is near one of the metro stop. For the past 4 years, I never had any issues with LAX. I actually flying in and out, because it is easy.\n\nYou can also fly into Burbank or Long Beach, but it is a little farther. Flying out of LAX is a breeze as well.\n\n* Accommodations (Tips for Graduation, move-in &amp; move-out): Book your hotel accommodations once you know the date of the graduation. Most people like to stay at the Ritz or one of the hotels along Century Boulevard. However, **our choice for 4 years has been Residence Inn in El Segundo on El Segundo Blvd.** It has a kitchen, quiet, free breakfast, parking onsite without height restrictions ($15.00 per night). Everyone is super nice.\n   * We have stayed at the Residence Inn on Century Boulevard (for move-in), but the parking is challenging as we navigate stairs and incline with luggages.  Parking has a vehicle height minimum. Shuttle Available.\n   * Then, the following year, we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott on Century Boulevard. Great hotel, lots of outdoor parking so vehicle height doesn't matter. The lobby is great, but then, the walk to the hotel room seems far especially after being tired from move-in all day. Shuttle available.\n   * The other hotel we tried was Hyatt Place LAX. The parking lot has a vehicle height minimum and the incline again was funky and was hard to navigate with the move-out/move-in of luggage and items. Liked the rooms. 15 mins. walk from LAX\n   * Courtyard LAX Century Blvd. on Vicksburg. Parking is open and no vehicle height, but $50 per night last time I was there. Super close to the airport and can walk there in 10-15 mins from the luggage depending if it is busy with traffic. Rooms are spacious.\n* How many days before the graduation? It depends on your schedule and availability. I thought that driving into town Thursday night the day before the baccalaureate mass (Friday) was enough, but we were exhausted. Friday was a whirlwind because of all the errands that we had to run just to prepare for graduation:\n   1. Find a last minute dog-sitter, because our original dog sitter in Manhattan Beach flaked. Found a better one at the local dog park. Thanks to Josh!\n   2. Picked up two amazing graduations cakes at Ador in Redondo Beach. Big thanks to Kaity! We loved the diary-free cake and the creme brulee! What a hit!\n   3. Grab lunch\n   4. relax for 1 hour before leaving fo the mass.\n* Baccalaureate mass: Wear comfy clothing, check the weather, and bring a sweater just in case if it is below 70 degrees. It was windy and cold on May 16, 2025. Many people left  right after communion, because it was super windy and cold. Bathrooms at the bottom of the building next to the library if you do not want to use the port-a-potties. Parking is super easy. There is water available. Missalettes were handed out. Communion was super long. The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins. Gave her time to spend with friends. There are golf carts/ADA sign available if you have mobility challenges. ADA seating is in the back of the garden.\n* Security: Remember clear bags or small purses (refer to the bag policy).  *My significant other had to walk back to the car and place his bag back at the vehicle.* They will then scan your ticket. This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front. It's a 1st come-1st serve basis. So, arrive early if you want the center aisle. *I wish that I did that because the camera did not televise the aisle where my youngest walked. I saw 15 seconds of her.* Remind people not to stand in front so that you can take pics of your graduate. Later in the ceremony, it became chaotic with all the parents standing in front of other people. I had to remind a few people to grab a chair next to us. Then, they were happy. Be on alert for the your graduate's school and name. The announcer spoke fast as if they were at an auction. if your graduate is an honors student, move near the fron railing and take a pic when they are announced. None of the honors students were televised. This event ended around 1:50 p.m.\n* Meeting place: After the event, pick a meeting place. *We stayed where we sat and took great pics from there.*\n* After ceremony events: If your graduate is not too tired, go straight to the naming wall. *We forgot to go there and it was gone the next day.* Each school has a reception. *We just took pics.*\n* Exiting parking structures and lots: It will take about 30 mins to exit. Traffic control will direct you where to go.\n* After parties: our graduates and their friends &amp; families were super tired, but we booked a restaurant back in Feb to accommodate 12 people.\n* Tickets: your graduate should be sending them to you via email. There is a QR Code.\n* Food: Pack your graduate a sandwich or snacks. They will be hungry (hangry) by the time the ceremony is done.\n\nI hope this helps parents, families, friends, and attendees with future graduates.\n\nCongratulations to the LMU's class of 2025!",

        "title": "What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate",
        "content": "This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.\n\n\n\n**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**\n\nThe vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on.

The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins. Gave her time to spend with friends. There are golf carts/ADA sign available if you have mobility challenges. ADA seating is in the back of the garden.\n* Security: Remember clear bags or small purses (refer to the bag policy).  *My significant other had to walk back to the car and place his bag back at the vehicle.* They will then scan your ticket. This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front. It's a 1st come-1st serve basis. So, arrive early if you want the center aisle. *I wish that I did that because the camera did not televise the aisle where my youngest walked. I saw 15 seconds of her.* Remind people not to stand in front so that you can take pics of your graduate. Later in the ceremony, it became chaotic with all the parents standing in front of other people. I had to remind a few people to grab a chair next to us. Then, they were happy. Be on alert for the your graduate's school and name. The announcer spoke fast as if they were at an auction. if your graduate is an honors student, move near the fron railing and take a pic when they are announced. None of the honors students were televised. This event ended around 1:50 p.m.\n* Meeting place: After the event, pick a meeting place. *We stayed where we sat and took great pics from there.*\n* After ceremony events: If your graduate is not too tired, go straight to the naming wall. *We forgot to go there and it was gone the next day.* Each school has a reception. *We just took pics.*\n* Exiting parking structures and lots: It will take about 30 mins to exit. Traffic control will direct you where to go.\n* After parties: our graduates and their friends &amp; families were super tired, but we booked a restaurant back in Feb to accommodate 12 people.\n* Tickets: your graduate should be sending them to you via email. There is a QR Code.\n* Food: Pack your graduate a sandwich or snacks. They will be hungry (hangry) by the time the ceremony is done.\n\nI hope this helps parents, families, friends, and attendees with future graduates.\n\nCongratulations to the LMU's class of 2025!",

        "title": "What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate",
        "content": "This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.\n\n\n\n**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**\n\nThe vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on. Practice doesn't make perfect, *targeted* practice makes perfect.\n\n  \n**#2 - You need to interact with artists outside of LMU.**\n\nMost LMU animation students interact primarily with other LMU animation students. You need to be networking and befriending animation students at *other universities*. Go to the CalArts open show, the ArtCenter grad show, meet USC animation students and UCLA animation students. These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.\n\n  \n**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!\n\nUse social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.\n\n  \n**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**\n\nThis is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: \"I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV\". \"I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation\". \"I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games\". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your \"deal\" is.\n\n\n\n**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**\n\nYour portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.\n\nYour portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (\"I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!\") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.\n\n  \n**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**\n\nYour short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.\n\n  \n**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**\n\nThousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. \n\nFor art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.\n\n  \n**#8 - Be a critical person.**\n\nLMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just \"good enough\".\n\nEveryone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. \n\n  \n**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**\n\nYou're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.\n\nAny time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!\n\n  \n**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**\n\nEvery role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.\n\n  \nGood luck future animation grads!",

        "title": "For Parents, Family members, friends, &amp; Attendees: Recap of  2025 and Tips for Graduation (Commencement) Ceremony &amp; Events",
        "content": "I looked through Reddit and LMU's website to plan for my youngest graduation events, celebrations, and ceremony and couldn't find the answers. So from my personal experiences, I am sharing them.\n\n* Flights: Book your flights once you know the date of the graduation. LAX is the closest and you can take a Lyft or Uber to your accommodation. It sounds like a big deal, but it really isn't. There are shuttles to hotels and you can take the shuttle to the metro to catch one of the lines if your accommodation is near one of the metro stop. For the past 4 years, I never had any issues with LAX. I actually flying in and out, because it is easy.\n\nYou can also fly into Burbank or Long Beach, but it is a little farther. Flying out of LAX is a breeze as well.\n\n* Accommodations (Tips for Graduation, move-in &amp; move-out): Book your hotel accommodations once you know the date of the graduation. Most people like to stay at the Ritz or one of the hotels along Century Boulevard. However, **our choice for 4 years has been Residence Inn in El Segundo on El Segundo Blvd.** It has a kitchen, quiet, free breakfast, parking onsite without height restrictions ($15.00 per night). Everyone is super nice.\n   * We have stayed at the Residence Inn on Century Boulevard (for move-in), but the parking is challenging as we navigate stairs and incline with luggages.  Parking has a vehicle height minimum. Shuttle Available.\n   * Then, the following year, we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott on Century Boulevard. Great hotel, lots of outdoor parking so vehicle height doesn't matter. The lobby is great, but then, the walk to the hotel room seems far especially after being tired from move-in all day. Shuttle available.\n   * The other hotel we tried was Hyatt Place LAX. The parking lot has a vehicle height minimum and the incline again was funky and was hard to navigate with the move-out/move-in of luggage and items. Liked the rooms. 15 mins. walk from LAX\n   * Courtyard LAX Century Blvd. on Vicksburg. Parking is open and no vehicle height, but $50 per night last time I was there. Super close to the airport and can walk there in 10-15 mins from the luggage depending if it is busy with traffic. Rooms are spacious.\n* How many days before the graduation? It depends on your schedule and availability. I thought that driving into town Thursday night the day before the baccalaureate mass (Friday) was enough, but we were exhausted. Friday was a whirlwind because of all the errands that we had to run just to prepare for graduation:\n   1. Find a last minute dog-sitter, because our original dog sitter in Manhattan Beach flaked. Found a better one at the local dog park. Thanks to Josh!\n   2. Picked up two amazing graduations cakes at Ador in Redondo Beach. Big thanks to Kaity! We loved the diary-free cake and the creme brulee! What a hit!\n   3. Grab lunch\n   4. relax for 1 hour before leaving fo the mass.\n* Baccalaureate mass: Wear comfy clothing, check the weather, and bring a sweater just in case if it is below 70 degrees. It was windy and cold on May 16, 2025. Many people left  right after communion, because it was super windy and cold. Bathrooms at the bottom of the building next to the library if you do not want to use the port-a-potties. Parking is super easy. There is water available. Missalettes were handed out. Communion was super long. The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins.

This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front.

I already have a degree in film, but it didn’t lead to stable work, so I applied to grad school hoping it would help me build a real future. I got in, but my situation has only gotten harder.\n\nI lost my apartment in 2023 and have been homeless ever since. I have no family or support system. I’ve been living in rental cars, driving Uber just to survive. I live paycheck to paycheck, and even then, I can’t afford a room.

        "title": "Not Just a Bible Study: A Warning for LMU Students",
        "content": "**Hey Lions,**\n\nThis is my third time sharing this with you all, and each time, it's been met with support, upvotes, and direct messages from students who’ve said it helped them feel informed and validated. I’ve carefully edited this post to follow this subreddit’s rules and to ensure it's respectful and constructive. I hope the mods will consider its purpose, which is to keep our campus community safe and aware, and allow it to stay up.\n\nLMU is a place that stands for critical thinking, truth, and respect for all people. But sometimes, unfortunately, that openness gets taken advantage of.\n\nRecently, students have been approached,  on campus and nearby spots like Westfield Culver City or Playa Vista, by people inviting them to “Bible studies” or asking if they've heard of “God the Mother” or a “hidden truth” in the Bible. These friendly invitations are coming from a group called the **World Mission Society Church of God (WMSCOG)**,  though you usually won’t hear that name until much later.\n\nHere’s what students across LA , from LMU to UCLA, USC, CSUN, and UC Irvine — have reported:\n\n* **They rarely identify who they are up front.** They’ll talk about faith or the Bible, but avoid saying they’re with WMSCOG until you’re already invested.\n* **They preach that God is a Korean woman, Zahng Gil-jah**, and that the end of the world is imminent,  but they wait to reveal this.\n* **Ex-members have described emotional pressure**, being asked to cut off family and friends, commit large amounts of time and money, and follow strict teachings based on fear.\n* **This is not just a local Bible group.** They are organized, well-trained, and intentionally targeting young adults, especially women, on campuses.\n\nThis isn’t just happening at LMU. Students across Southern California have spoken out, and some universities have begun hosting panels and forums to raise awareness about high-pressure or manipulative religious recruitment.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about attacking anyone’s faith. LMU values spiritual exploration and freedom of religion. But **faith must be chosen freely, not manipulated, not sold under pressure, and not masked by secrecy.**\n\nIf you’ve been approached, you are *not* alone. Trust your instincts. Ask questions. Do your research. The more informed our community is, the less space there is for deception.\n\n# To the mods, again, I’ve posted this three times now. Students are engaging with it because it’s something real that’s happening to them. I’ve edited this carefully to meet the rules, and I hope you'll consider its value. If it’s removed again, I can’t help but question whether you're unintentionally protecting an organization that is repeatedly accused of predatory behavior.\n\n**Let’s keep LMU a place where belief is genuine — not manipulated, not coerced.**\n\n**A Concerned Student Who Cares About Truth and Freedom of Thought**",

        "title": "For Parents, Family members, friends, &amp; Attendees: Recap of  2025 and Tips for Graduation (Commencement) Ceremony &amp; Events",
        "content": "I looked through Reddit and LMU's website to plan for my youngest graduation events, celebrations, and ceremony and couldn't find the answers. So from my personal experiences, I am sharing them.\n\n* Flights: Book your flights once you know the date of the graduation. LAX is the closest and you can take a Lyft or Uber to your accommodation. It sounds like a big deal, but it really isn't. There are shuttles to hotels and you can take the shuttle to the metro to catch one of the lines if your accommodation is near one of the metro stop. For the past 4 years, I never had any issues with LAX. I actually flying in and out, because it is easy.\n\nYou can also fly into Burbank or Long Beach, but it is a little farther. Flying out of LAX is a breeze as well.\n\n* Accommodations (Tips for Graduation, move-in &amp; move-out): Book your hotel accommodations once you know the date of the graduation. Most people like to stay at the Ritz or one of the hotels along Century Boulevard. However, **our choice for 4 years has been Residence Inn in El Segundo on El Segundo Blvd.** It has a kitchen, quiet, free breakfast, parking onsite without height restrictions ($15.00 per night). Everyone is super nice.\n   * We have stayed at the Residence Inn on Century Boulevard (for move-in), but the parking is challenging as we navigate stairs and incline with luggages.  Parking has a vehicle height minimum. Shuttle Available.\n   * Then, the following year, we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott on Century Boulevard. Great hotel, lots of outdoor parking so vehicle height doesn't matter. The lobby is great, but then, the walk to the hotel room seems far especially after being tired from move-in all day. Shuttle available.\n   * The other hotel we tried was Hyatt Place LAX. The parking lot has a vehicle height minimum and the incline again was funky and was hard to navigate with the move-out/move-in of luggage and items. Liked the rooms. 15 mins. walk from LAX\n   * Courtyard LAX Century Blvd. on Vicksburg. Parking is open and no vehicle height, but $50 per night last time I was there. Super close to the airport and can walk there in 10-15 mins from the luggage depending if it is busy with traffic. Rooms are spacious.\n* How many days before the graduation? It depends on your schedule and availability. I thought that driving into town Thursday night the day before the baccalaureate mass (Friday) was enough, but we were exhausted. Friday was a whirlwind because of all the errands that we had to run just to prepare for graduation:\n   1. Find a last minute dog-sitter, because our original dog sitter in Manhattan Beach flaked. Found a better one at the local dog park. Thanks to Josh!\n   2. Picked up two amazing graduations cakes at Ador in Redondo Beach. Big thanks to Kaity! We loved the diary-free cake and the creme brulee! What a hit!\n   3. Grab lunch\n   4. relax for 1 hour before leaving fo the mass.\n* Baccalaureate mass: Wear comfy clothing, check the weather, and bring a sweater just in case if it is below 70 degrees. It was windy and cold on May 16, 2025. Many people left  right after communion, because it was super windy and cold. Bathrooms at the bottom of the building next to the library if you do not want to use the port-a-potties. Parking is super easy. There is water available. Missalettes were handed out. Communion was super long. The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins. Gave her time to spend with friends. There are golf carts/ADA sign available if you have mobility challenges. ADA seating is in the back of the garden.\n* Security: Remember clear bags or small purses (refer to the bag policy).  *My significant other had to walk back to the car and place his bag back at the vehicle.* They will then scan your ticket. This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front. It's a 1st come-1st serve basis. So, arrive early if you want the center aisle. *I wish that I did that because the camera did not televise the aisle where my youngest walked. I saw 15 seconds of her.* Remind people not to stand in front so that you can take pics of your graduate. Later in the ceremony, it became chaotic with all the parents standing in front of other people. I had to remind a few people to grab a chair next to us. Then, they were happy. Be on alert for the your graduate's school and name. The announcer spoke fast as if they were at an auction. if your graduate is an honors student, move near the fron railing and take a pic when they are announced. None of the honors students were televised. This event ended around 1:50 p.m.\n* Meeting place: After the event, pick a meeting place. *We stayed where we sat and took great pics from there.*\n* After ceremony events: If your graduate is not too tired, go straight to the naming wall. *We forgot to go there and it was gone the next day.* Each school has a reception. *We just took pics.*\n* Exiting parking structures and lots: It will take about 30 mins to exit. Traffic control will direct you where to go.\n* After parties: our graduates and their friends &amp; families were super tired, but we booked a restaurant back in Feb to accommodate 12 people.\n* Tickets: your graduate should be sending them to you via email. There is a QR Code.\n* Food: Pack your graduate a sandwich or snacks. They will be hungry (hangry) by the time the ceremony is done.\n\nI hope this helps parents, families, friends, and attendees with future graduates.\n\nCongratulations to the LMU's class of 2025!",

        "title": "What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate",
        "content": "This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.\n\n\n\n**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**\n\nThe vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on. Practice doesn't make perfect, *targeted* practice makes perfect.\n\n  \n**#2 - You need to interact with artists outside of LMU.**\n\nMost LMU animation students interact primarily with other LMU animation students. You need to be networking and befriending animation students at *other universities*. Go to the CalArts open show, the ArtCenter grad show, meet USC animation students and UCLA animation students. These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.\n\n  \n**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!\n\nUse social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.\n\n  \n**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**\n\nThis is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: \"I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV\". \"I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation\". \"I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games\". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your \"deal\" is.\n\n\n\n**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**\n\nYour portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.\n\nYour portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (\"I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!\") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.\n\n  \n**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**\n\nYour short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.\n\n  \n**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**\n\nThousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. \n\nFor art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.\n\n  \n**#8 - Be a critical person.**\n\nLMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just \"good enough\".\n\nEveryone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. \n\n  \n**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**\n\nYou're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.\n\nAny time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!\n\n  \n**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**\n\nEvery role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.\n\n  \nGood luck future animation grads!",

        "content": "**Hey Lions,**\n\nThis is my third time sharing this with you all, and each time, it's been met with support, upvotes, and direct messages from students who’ve said it helped them feel informed and validated. I’ve carefully edited this post to follow this subreddit’s rules and to ensure it's respectful and constructive. I hope the mods will consider its purpose, which is to keep our campus community safe and aware, and allow it to stay up.\n\nLMU is a place that stands for critical thinking, truth, and respect for all people. But sometimes, unfortunately, that openness gets taken advantage of.\n\nRecently, students have been approached,  on campus and nearby spots like Westfield Culver City or Playa Vista, by people inviting them to “Bible studies” or asking if they've heard of “God the Mother” or a “hidden truth” in the Bible. These friendly invitations are coming from a group called the **World Mission Society Church of God (WMSCOG)**,  though you usually won’t hear that name until much later.\n\nHere’s what students across LA , from LMU to UCLA, USC, CSUN, and UC Irvine — have reported:\n\n* **They rarely identify who they are up front.** They’ll talk about faith or the Bible, but avoid saying they’re with WMSCOG until you’re already invested.\n* **They preach that God is a Korean woman, Zahng Gil-jah**, and that the end of the world is imminent,  but they wait to reveal this.\n* **Ex-members have described emotional pressure**, being asked to cut off family and friends, commit large amounts of time and money, and follow strict teachings based on fear.\n* **This is not just a local Bible group.** They are organized, well-trained, and intentionally targeting young adults, especially women, on campuses.\n\nThis isn’t just happening at LMU. Students across Southern California have spoken out, and some universities have begun hosting panels and forums to raise awareness about high-pressure or manipulative religious recruitment.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about attacking anyone’s faith. LMU values spiritual exploration and freedom of religion. But **faith must be chosen freely, not manipulated, not sold under pressure, and not masked by secrecy.**\n\nIf you’ve been approached, you are *not* alone. Trust your instincts. Ask questions. Do your research. The more informed our community is, the less space there is for deception.\n\n# To the mods, again, I’ve posted this three times now.

        "content": "I looked through Reddit and LMU's website to plan for my youngest graduation events, celebrations, and ceremony and couldn't find the answers. So from my personal experiences, I am sharing them.\n\n* Flights: Book your flights once you know the date of the graduation. LAX is the closest and you can take a Lyft or Uber to your accommodation. It sounds like a big deal, but it really isn't. There are shuttles to hotels and you can take the shuttle to the metro to catch one of the lines if your accommodation is near one of the metro stop. For the past 4 years, I never had any issues with LAX. I actually flying in and out, because it is easy.\n\nYou can also fly into Burbank or Long Beach, but it is a little farther. Flying out of LAX is a breeze as well.\n\n* Accommodations (Tips for Graduation, move-in &amp; move-out): Book your hotel accommodations once you know the date of the graduation. Most people like to stay at the Ritz or one of the hotels along Century Boulevard. However, **our choice for 4 years has been Residence Inn in El Segundo on El Segundo Blvd.** It has a kitchen, quiet, free breakfast, parking onsite without height restrictions ($15.00 per night). Everyone is super nice.\n   * We have stayed at the Residence Inn on Century Boulevard (for move-in), but the parking is challenging as we navigate stairs and incline with luggages.  Parking has a vehicle height minimum. Shuttle Available.\n   * Then, the following year, we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott on Century Boulevard. Great hotel, lots of outdoor parking so vehicle height doesn't matter. The lobby is great, but then, the walk to the hotel room seems far especially after being tired from move-in all day. Shuttle available.\n   * The other hotel we tried was Hyatt Place LAX. The parking lot has a vehicle height minimum and the incline again was funky and was hard to navigate with the move-out/move-in of luggage and items. Liked the rooms. 15 mins. walk from LAX\n   * Courtyard LAX Century Blvd. on Vicksburg. Parking is open and no vehicle height, but $50 per night last time I was there. Super close to the airport and can walk there in 10-15 mins from the luggage depending if it is busy with traffic. Rooms are spacious.\n* How many days before the graduation? It depends on your schedule and availability. I thought that driving into town Thursday night the day before the baccalaureate mass (Friday) was enough, but we were exhausted. Friday was a whirlwind because of all the errands that we had to run just to prepare for graduation:\n   1. Find a last minute dog-sitter, because our original dog sitter in Manhattan Beach flaked. Found a better one at the local dog park. Thanks to Josh!\n   2. Picked up two amazing graduations cakes at Ador in Redondo Beach. Big thanks to Kaity! We loved the diary-free cake and the creme brulee! What a hit!\n   3. Grab lunch\n   4. relax for 1 hour before leaving fo the mass.\n* Baccalaureate mass: Wear comfy clothing, check the weather, and bring a sweater just in case if it is below 70 degrees. It was windy and cold on May 16, 2025. Many people left  right after communion, because it was super windy and cold. Bathrooms at the bottom of the building next to the library if you do not want to use the port-a-potties. Parking is super easy. There is water available. Missalettes were handed out. Communion was super long. The entire mass was 2.5 hours.\n* Get enough sleep the night before, because graduation is a event that takes up all day long. *Unfortunately, we had a major tire issue and had to deal with that starting the night before.*\n* We left at 7:15 a.m. and parked at the back entrance by 7:40 a.m. My youngest graduate was able to walk over to the gym in 5 mins. Gave her time to spend with friends. There are golf carts/ADA sign available if you have mobility challenges. ADA seating is in the back of the garden.\n* Security: Remember clear bags or small purses (refer to the bag policy).  *My significant other had to walk back to the car and place his bag back at the vehicle.* They will then scan your ticket. This part was super easy.\n* Bathrooms, port-a-potties - they are monitored and cleaned quite often. Long lines though. There are a few handicap facilities available. There are bathrooms available for the graduates behind the stage. Remind them to use it if they need to. It's a long event for them.\n* Weather: Check the weather often before you pack. I saw that it was cold, windy, and may rain. I packed a t-shirt, nice sweater, business casual jacket, and raincoat; nice pants, and Dr. Martens boots. I wore them all. It was still freezing, started to rain and then, it became windy. I heard that it was once hot (around 80 degrees+). So, again pack accordingly.\n* Snacks and drinks: You can pack your own and bring your clear water bottle. Because the ceremony was so long, we looked for snacks for 1.5 hour and finally found it. Don't go to the nearest booths, because they only take cash.\n* Ceremony: Graduates need to be at the gym by 8 a.m. It was so long and started late (10:30 a.m.) Ideal spot was to sit on the major aisle with no chairs in front. It's a 1st come-1st serve basis. So, arrive early if you want the center aisle. *I wish that I did that because the camera did not televise the aisle where my youngest walked. I saw 15 seconds of her.* Remind people not to stand in front so that you can take pics of your graduate. Later in the ceremony, it became chaotic with all the parents standing in front of other people. I had to remind a few people to grab a chair next to us. Then, they were happy. Be on alert for the your graduate's school and name. The announcer spoke fast as if they were at an auction. if your graduate is an honors student, move near the fron railing and take a pic when they are announced. None of the honors students were televised. This event ended around 1:50 p.m.\n* Meeting place: After the event, pick a meeting place. *We stayed where we sat and took great pics from there.*\n* After ceremony events: If your graduate is not too tired, go straight to the naming wall. *We forgot to go there and it was gone the next day.* Each school has a reception. *We just took pics.*\n* Exiting parking structures and lots: It will take about 30 mins to exit. Traffic control will direct you where to go.\n* After parties: our graduates and their friends &amp; families were super tired, but we booked a restaurant back in Feb to accommodate 12 people.\n* Tickets: your graduate should be sending them to you via email. There is a QR Code.\n* Food: Pack your graduate a sandwich or snacks. They will be hungry (hangry) by the time the ceremony is done.\n\nI hope this helps parents, families, friends, and attendees with future graduates.\n\nCongratulations to the LMU's class of 2025!",

        "title": "What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate",
        "content": "This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.\n\n\n\n**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**\n\nThe vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on. Practice doesn't make perfect, *targeted* practice makes perfect.\n\n  \n**#2 - You need to interact with artists outside of LMU.**\n\nMost LMU animation students interact primarily with other LMU animation students. You need to be networking and befriending animation students at *other universities*. Go to the CalArts open show, the ArtCenter grad show, meet USC animation students and UCLA animation students. These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.\n\n  \n**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!\n\nUse social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.\n\n  \n**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**\n\nThis is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: \"I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV\". \"I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation\". \"I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games\". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your \"deal\" is.\n\n\n\n**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**\n\nYour portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.\n\nYour portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (\"I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!\") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.\n\n  \n**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**\n\nYour short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.\n\n  \n**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**\n\nThousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. \n\nFor art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.\n\n  \n**#8 - Be a critical person.**\n\nLMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just \"good enough\".\n\nEveryone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. \n\n  \n**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**\n\nYou're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.\n\nAny time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!\n\n  \n**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**\n\nEvery role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.\n\n  \nGood luck future animation grads!",
